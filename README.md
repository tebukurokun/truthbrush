# truthbrush
Truthbrush is an API client for Truth Social. Truthbrush is built and maintained by the [Stanford Internet Observatory](https://io.stanford.edu).

Currently, this tool can:

* Search for users, statuses, or hashtags
* Pull a user's statuses
* Pull the list of "People to Follow" or suggested users
* Pull "trending" hashtags
* Pull "trending" Truth posts
* Pull ads
* Pull a user's metadata

Truthbrush is designed for academic research, open source intelligence gathering, and data archival. It pulls all of the data from the publicly accessible API.

## Installation

Truthbrush is not yet available on PyPI. To install it, run `pip install git+https://github.com/stanfordio/truthbrush.git`, or clone the repository and run `pip3 install .`. Provided your `pip` is setup correctly, this will make `truthbrush` available both as a command and as a Python package. **Note that Truthbrush requires Python 3.8 or higher.**

After installation, you will need to set your Truth Social username and password as environmental variables.

`export TRUTHSOCIAL_USERNAME=foo`

`export TRUTHSOCIAL_PASSWORD=bar`
